# **App Name**: HEIC Hero

## Core Features:

- Drag and Drop Upload: Drag and drop HEIC files onto the application window.
- Automatic Conversion: Automatically convert HEIC files to JPEG format.
- Conversion Status: Display the conversion status (e.g., 'Processing', 'Completed', 'Failed') for each file in real-time.
- Auto Save Location: Save the converted JPEG files in the same folder as the original HEIC files.
- Smart Compression: Utilize AI to determine the optimal JPEG compression level for each image, balancing file size and visual quality. This tool will improve compression with minimal loss of quality.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft gray (#D3D3D3) for the background to provide a neutral and clean canvas.
- Background color: White (#FFFFFF) for the application's main content area, ensuring clarity and simplicity.
- Accent color: Success Green (#1A5632) is used sparingly to indicate successful conversions and actions, providing a positive visual cue.
- Font: 'Inter' sans-serif for a modern, machined and neutral appearance, suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Simple, minimalist icons to represent file types and conversion status (e.g., a document icon for HEIC files, a checkmark for success, an 'x' for failure).
- A clean and intuitive layout with a prominent drag-and-drop area and a clear list of files with their conversion statuses.
- Subtle animations, such as a progress bar during conversion, to provide feedback to the user without being distracting.
